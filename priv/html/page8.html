Let's see what you just did: you evaluated a list where the first element is the function itself, defined on the spot - and the other elements are the arguments that you pass to the function. That's exactly the same syntax that you used earlier on to call functions like `square` or even `+`. The only difference is that now you defined the function in the same place where you called it.

Remember `defn`? Now I can tell you a secret: `defn` is actually just a bit of syntactic sugar around `def` and `fn`. You've just seen `fn` at work: it defines a new function.`def` binds the newly defined function to a name.

If you want, you can create a named function without using `defn`: type `(def square (fn [x] (* x x)))` to continue.
