Let's now turn to data structures.

All data structures in Clojerl are implemented based on Erlang's, but they are not identical. When calling or using Erang code that requires a specific type you can resort to the "#erl" reader macro. This will let you specify Erlang literals in the following way:

    #erl(1 2 :three 4 5 :six) ;; Erlang list

    #erl"Hello world!" ;; Erlang string

    #erl[:a 1 :c] ;; Erlang tuple

    #erl{:a 1 :b 2} ;; Erlang map

Try any of the expressions above. Each one has a type associated to it, which is different from their Clojerl equivalents. Type the following expression to check this "(= (type {}) (type #erl{}))".
