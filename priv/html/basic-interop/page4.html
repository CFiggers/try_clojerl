One of Erlang's most useful features is pattern matching, which is very powerful.

Clojerl provides support for pattern matching through some of the special forms. The main ones are "let*", "fn*" and "case*". When handling errors and exceptions, it is also possible to use pattern matching in "catch" clauses.

Let's try is with a "case*" expression. First we will define the following function:

    (defn one? [x]
      (case* x
        1 true
        _ false))

Now let's call this function to check if it works. First let's call it with 2 as an argument "(one? 2)" and it should return "false". Then let's call it with 1, "(one? 1)".
