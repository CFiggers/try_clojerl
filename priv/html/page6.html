Congratulations - you just defined your first Clojure function. Many more will follow!

`defn` takes the name of the function, then the list of arguments, and then the body of the function. I told you that a Clojure program is made of lists, right? The entire `defn` is a list, and the function body is also a list. (Even the arguments are collected in a vector, which is similar to a list - we'll talk about vectors soon).

Oh, sorry for talking so long - you probably want to try out your brand new function! Type `(square 10)`.
