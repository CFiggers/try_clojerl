It is also possible to use pattern matching at a function definition level using "defn*" instead of "defn".

We can redefine the function "one?" using "defn*" and doing without the usage of "case*".

    (defn* one?
      ([1] true)
      ([_] false))

Now try this redefined function to see if it works by typing the same expressions as before "(one? 2)" and then "(one? 1)".
